							Has someone ever told you that it's not an anime/manga if it's not
							made in Japan? Or maybe you've heard people say "(enter non-black
							character name here) can't be black" to a cosplayer or artist?
							What about the tried and true question "Why do they have to race
							swap? Can't they make original characters?" It's a never-ending
							discussion of why someone who looks like you shouldn't have your
							story told. We saw that need and decided to create Spectorals.

							We're a new kind of storytelling platform designed by those who
							feel left out of the medium. Artists and writers alike can tell
							their stories in their own voice and style, without being hindered
							by the rules and restrictions of traditional publishing. Our tools
							allow you to tell your story, in your way.

							We live in a time where the power to tell stories is more
							accessible than ever. And we believe that specific stories can
							make a difference. So not only have we created a platform for us
							to achieve our dreams and a style that represents every facet of
							us. We've also designed genre symbols to use for your works. Our
							symbols encompass the genre as a whole and also embrace that
							culture. It's as if we created a language for every type of
							storyteller.

							Our hope is that what we all create together can be the next
							culture-defining thing like Hip-Hop. But with the nuance of every
							creator owning everything from the very beginning. No more running
							for publishing or movie deals with no sense of ownership.
							Everything that comes out of this new culture will be owned by the
							people, and all of the fruits of its labor will go to the ones who
							made it possible. It's time to open new doors of expression.
